# HealthAi

## The healthcare system faces various challenges, and a project aims to solve them by using artificial intelligence. The project offers features like predicting potential skin cancer and recommending qualified doctors, detecting diseases from symptoms and recommending further medical attention, identifying diabetic retinopathy by analyzing images of the retina, and providing a dashboard for both doctors and patients. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze medical images and symptom descriptions, improving patient outcomes, and reducing the burden on the healthcare system. The online platform makes healthcare more accessible and convenient for patients.
